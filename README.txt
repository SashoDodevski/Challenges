This challenge I created git repository for each past Challenge. 
I added the whole Challenges to the staging area using the git command: git add .
Later I committed the Challenges to the local repository using git command: git commit -m {Branch name}
Later I pushed every local repository to remote repository od my account on GitLab.
I created new Project on GitLab called BrainsterChallenges_SashoDodevskiFS9, where I pushed each challenge as new Branch.
On Project BrainsterChallenges_SashoDodevskiFS9 there are all my Challenges I created so far.
The plan is all of the Challenges that I will create to be pushed on the GitLab Project called BrainsterChallenges_SashoDodevskiFS9.
